# PenDownDigitally
This project allows users to store their precious moments and revisit them digitally. 
This hands-on project is built using basic functionalities of JavaScript:

  [Event Listener] -> To add cards in the main page, navigation to next and previous page and delete the cards when prompted by the user.
  
  [Create Element] -> Method that creates and appends the user inputted values, changes dynamically based on user input.
  
  [Local Storage]  -> To store the data's in the cards locally in the browser storage to prevent the loss of information on refreshing.

coupled along with the visually appealing CSS and major concepts of CSS like:

(positioning) -> Used in styling the add button and for psoitioning it in the webpage.

(Z-index) -> To avoid the overlap between the cards and the background image.

(two div's) -> To hide the content in the background and display the welcome pop-up (set in the block mode for full-screen coverage)

The overall layout of this project is scaffolded into three main section:

  I) HOME SECTION => which displays the cards capturing the memories.
  
  II) ABOUT US  => A brief "promotional-message-card" that encourages the users to digitally pen their memories.
  
  III) IMPORTANCE => Famous "quotes-card" about importance of journaling and penning the memories digitally.

Overall, this project gave me a good grip in JavaScript basic concepts as well as it increased the clarity much better in CSS as well.
